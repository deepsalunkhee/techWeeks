### 🧠 JSP + Servlet Flow

---

**🟢 User Requests a JSP Page (e.g., `login.jsp`)**

→ Browser sends an HTTP GET request to `login.jsp`

---

**🛠️ JSP is Processed on Server**

→ Server checks: “Has this JSP already been compiled?”

- ❌ If **not compiled yet**:
    
    - Server **converts `login.jsp` to `login_jsp.java`**
        
    - Then **compiles** that into `login_jsp.class` (a servlet!)
        
- ✅ If **already compiled**, it skips conversion.
    

---

**⚙️ Server Executes the Generated Servlet (`login_jsp.class`)**

→ The servlet executes any Java code inside the JSP  
→ Generates the final HTML output

---

**📤 HTML Response Sent to Browser**

→ Browser receives plain HTML  
→ Displays the login form to the user  
→ User doesn’t see any Java code at all

---

**✍️ User Fills the Form and Clicks "Submit"**

→ Form’s `action="LoginServlet"` and `method="POST"`

→ Browser sends POST request to `LoginServlet`

---

**🧠 Server Runs Your `LoginServlet.java`**

→ This is the servlet _you_ wrote manually  
→ It handles logic like:

- Reading form data
    
- Checking credentials
    
- Starting a session
    
- Redirecting to `home.jsp` or returning to `login.jsp` with error
    

---

**🔁 Servlet Might Forward to Another JSP (e.g., `home.jsp`)**

→ That JSP runs like step one:

- Compiled if not already
    
- Executed to generate HTML
    
- HTML sent to client
    

---

### 🧩 Final Summary:

- **JSPs are views** → They generate HTML.
    
- **JSPs become servlets under the hood** → You don’t write that conversion.
    
- **Your servlets (like `LoginServlet.java`) are controllers** → They handle real logic.
    
- The **browser only sees HTML**. Java never leaves the server.
